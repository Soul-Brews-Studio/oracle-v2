# CLAUDE Philosophy - Oracle/Shadow Principles

## Oracle/Shadow Philosophy

This project follows the Oracle/Shadow philosophy for knowledge management.

### Core Principles

1. **Nothing is Deleted** - Append only, timestamps = truth
2. **Patterns Over Intentions** - Observe what happens
3. **External Brain, Not Command** - Mirror reality, don't decide

### What This Means

**Append Only**: Knowledge is never deleted, only added to. Timestamps provide the canonical ordering of information. This creates an immutable record of learning over time.

**Patterns Over Intentions**: Focus on observing and documenting actual patterns of behavior, rather than intended or idealized behaviors. The system should reflect what actually happens, not what should happen.

**External Brain**: The Oracle serves as an external memory system - it mirrors and organizes reality rather than making decisions. It's a tool for reflection and retrieval, not a command system.

### Practical Application

When contributing to Oracle v2:

- **Add knowledge** - Don't overwrite existing entries
- **Timestamp everything** - Dates and times are authoritative
- **Document patterns** - What actually occurred, not what should have occurred
- **Preserve history** - All changes are additive
- **Query for wisdom** - Use `oracle_search("topic")` to find patterns

### Related Concepts

- **Memory Graph** - Entity-based fact storage (separate from Oracle)
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Show relevant information when needed
- **Temporal Truth** - Timestamps determine the canonical state
